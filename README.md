# Ely GPUI Component

A component library for [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs), the Rust UI framework behind Zed.
Every component ships in light and dark. The palette is warm and quiet. Color carries meaning, not decoration.

Every component runs live at https://elygpui.com, compiled to WebAssembly.

Status: early. `TASKS.md` tracks every component, chapter by chapter. To help, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Use

```toml
[dependencies]
ely-gpui-component = { git = "https://github.com/ELY-Open-Source/Ely-GPUI-Components" }
gpui = { package = "gpui-pre", version = "=0.3.8" }
gpui_platform = { package = "gpui-pre-platform", version = "=0.3.8", features = ["font-kit"] }
```

```rust
use ely_gpui_component::{Assets, theme::{Mode, Theme}};
use gpui::App;

fn main() {
    gpui_platform::application().with_assets(Assets).run(|cx: &mut App| {
        ely_gpui_component::init(cx).expect("Ely failed to start");
        Theme::set_mode(Mode::Dark, cx);
    });
}
```

`init` registers the fonts and the theme. It returns an error if the application's asset source cannot load one of Ely's files.

## With GPUI Kit

Ely runs beside Longbridge's [GPUI Kit](https://gpui-kit.com) in one window, on the GPUI snapshot Kit 0.7.1 pins. Pass `Assets::before(gpui_kit::assets::Assets)` as the one asset source, call both `init`s, open the window with `gpui_kit::open_window`, and wrap the view in Ely's root `FocusScope`. The [guide](https://elygpui.com/docs/gpui-kit) covers themes, focus and the inspector; `compat/kit` holds a whole app and the tests behind each claim.

## Gallery

```sh
cargo run --example gallery
cargo run --example gallery -- --page buttons
cargo run --example gallery -- --capture shots   # macOS: PNG of every page, light and dark
ELY_GALLERY_ASSETS=https://example.com/gallery/assets/ scripts/web.sh dist   # for the browser
```

In a browser, `?page=buttons&story=icon-button&theme=dark` draws one section alone; `examples/gallery/stories.json` lists them all.

## Website

```sh
cd frontend
pnpm install
ELY_GALLERY_ASSETS=https://<site>/gallery/assets/ pnpm gallery   # the wasm gallery, into public/gallery
pnpm dev        # or: pnpm build && pnpm preview; both fetch the showcase at showcase.lock's commit
ELY_SHOWCASE=../../Ely-GPUI-Showcases pnpm dev   # the showcase from a local checkout
node scripts/og.mjs   # with pnpm preview up: public/og.png from the hero
node scripts/favicon.mjs   # public/favicon.svg, apple-touch-icon.png and ../logo.png from the mark
pnpm deploy     # Cloudflare, through wrangler
```

## Build notes

- gpui compiles its Metal shaders at runtime here (`runtime_shaders`, on by default), so a full Xcode install is not required. gpui_platform needs `font-kit`, or macOS draws no text.
- CI tests the crate and builds the gallery on macOS, Windows and Linux, arm64 and x86_64. The capture tool needs macOS.
